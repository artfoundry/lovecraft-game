As it does, something else happens: a pulsing, undulating mass forms in front of it, at first no bigger than ant hill. But it quickly grows, and as it does so, the pits and bulges in its surface begin to open, revealing in their places, chattering maws and searching eyes. The mass sprouts tentacles and tubular appendages in every direction as it grows and grows, until it's no smaller than an automobile!\n\nYour mind reels from this terrifying vision, yet you can't seem to pull your gaze away from it.",
